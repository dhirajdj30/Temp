# Step-by-Step Guide: Feature Extraction from Images

## 1. Set Up the Environment

1.1. Create a new Python environment (e.g., using conda or venv)
1.2. Install required libraries:
   - PyTorch (for deep learning)
   - torchvision (for image processing)
   - pandas (for data manipulation)
   - numpy (for numerical operations)
   - Pillow (for image handling)
   - requests (for downloading images)

## 2. Data Preparation

2.1. Load and explore the dataset:
   - Read train.csv and test.csv using pandas
   - Analyze the distribution of group_ids and entity_names

2.2. Download images:
   - Use the provided `download_images` function from src/utils.py
   - Create a function to batch download images for train and test sets

2.3. Preprocess images:
   - Resize images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 for standard CNN architectures)
   - Normalize pixel values

2.4. Create a custom Dataset class:
   - Implement a PyTorch Dataset class that loads images and labels
   - Include data augmentation techniques (e.g., random crops, flips, rotations)

## 3. Model Development

3.1. Choose a base model:
   - Select a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) as the feature extractor

3.2. Design the model architecture:
   - Add custom layers on top of the base model for entity extraction
   - Consider using attention mechanisms to focus on relevant image regions

3.3. Implement the loss function:
   - Use a combination of classification loss (for entity presence) and regression loss (for numeric values)

3.4. Set up the training loop:
   - Implement functions for training, validation, and inference
   - Use appropriate optimizers (e.g., Adam) and learning rate schedulers

## 4. Training and Optimization

4.1. Train the model:
   - Start with a small subset of data to ensure the pipeline works
   - Train on the full dataset, using cross-validation to assess performance

4.2. Monitor and visualize:
   - Track training and validation losses
   - Implement tensorboard or a similar tool for visualization

4.3. Hyperparameter tuning:
   - Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and model architectures
   - Consider using techniques like learning rate finder and gradual unfreezing

## 5. Inference and Output Generation

5.1. Implement inference pipeline:
   - Load the trained model
   - Process test images and generate predictions

5.2. Post-process predictions:
   - Convert raw model outputs to the required format ("x unit")
   - Ensure predictions use only allowed units from constants.py

5.3. Generate output file:
   - Create a CSV file with 'index' and 'prediction' columns
   - Ensure the format matches sample_test_out.csv

## 6. Validation and Submission

6.1. Run sanity checks:
   - Use src/sanity.py to verify the output format
   - Ensure all test samples have a prediction (use "" for uncertain cases)

6.2. Evaluate model performance:
   - If possible, create a local validation set to estimate F1 score

6.3. Prepare final submission:
   - Generate predictions for the full test set
   - Double-check the output format and run final sanity checks

## 7. Documentation and Code Organization

7.1. Organize your code:
   - Create separate modules for data processing, model architecture, training, and inference
   - Use clear and consistent naming conventions

7.2. Write documentation:
   - Include docstrings for main functions and classes
   - Create a README file explaining how to run your code and reproduce results

7.3. Version control:
   - Use Git to track changes and manage your project

## 8. Potential Enhancements

8.1. Ensemble methods:
   - Train multiple models with different architectures or initializations
   - Combine predictions using voting or averaging

8.2. Advanced techniques:
   - Experiment with object detection models for locating entity information
   - Try transformer-based architectures for better contextual understanding

8.3. Error analysis:
   - Analyze common mistake patterns in your model's predictions
   - Use this insight to refine your approach or post-processing steps
